Repository with 4-parts (_Driver_, Client, Server, Panel)

**Driver(Windows):** (REMOVED)

**Client(Windows):**
The client has a simple login simple, (**Client** <-> **Server** communcation is super shit) and maps the driver from bytes(**Kdmapper** Lol). The **Fortnite** external has only Esp for now more features to come maybe. 

**Server(Linux):**
Handles the **client** login, the keys, expiration and the panel creating/deleting keys. Code needs to be fixed & cleaned.

**Panel(Windows):**
Just to create and delete keys.
